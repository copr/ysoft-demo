Write a web application (in Java) which meets the following requirements:

    Allow users to enter a string which will be encrypted or decrypted by a selected algorithm
    Implement encryption to Morse code and decryption from Morse code
    Your design and solution should allow an easy extension of the application by adding another encryption and decryption algorithms (a Caesar cipher for example)
    Show your programming skills as well as your problem-solving skills. A clean and readable design and code and adhering to the KISS principle is much more important than applying artificially all the design patterns you know.
